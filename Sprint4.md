<h3>Application Overview</h3>
<hr/>

OLX CLONE is the title of our application. 

<p align="justify">OLX is a web platform that brings buyers and sellers of various items and properties together. For example, if a person wants to sell their bicycle, they will post an advertisement on OLX. Interested users can buy the bike from them.</p> 

<p align="justify">This program has various advantages, including no limit on the number of individuals who can view the product. Because it's an online application, anyone with an internet connection can readily view the goods. Because of the increased reach, more merchants can sell the product to whoever offers them the best profit.</p>
